# Numerical Solutions For Tunnelling Through Potential Barriers

In my second Python project, I looked at numerical solutions for tunnelling through potential barriers. By modelling a theoretical potential barrier, and altering its shape, both by changing its potential as well as its width - I computed different numerical solutions for Schroedinger's equation in order to model quantum tunnelling.

Ultimately, I found that the width of the barrier contributes greatly to throwing off numerical solutions when compared to the theoretical solutions for a potential of the same shape.
